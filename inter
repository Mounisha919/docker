## 1. **They Will Expect You to Design Solutions**

Example Questions:

* *“How do you handle Dockerized microservices logging in production?”*
* *“You have 50 microservices running in containers, how will you monitor them?”*
* *“If your app needs persistent data, how will you design storage for containers?”*

✅ **How to Answer (Example – Logging in Production):**

> “For production logging, I avoid relying only on `docker logs`. Instead, I configure a centralized logging system using **Fluentd + Elasticsearch + Kibana (EFK)** or **Splunk**.
> Each container’s stdout/stderr is forwarded by Fluentd to Elasticsearch, where logs are indexed and searchable. This helps with correlation across microservices. I also configure **log rotation** at the Docker daemon level (`max-size`, `max-file`) to prevent disk space issues.”

---

## 2. **They Will Test Troubleshooting Skills**

Example Questions:

* *“What do you do if a container is restarting continuously?”*
* *“How do you debug when containers cannot communicate with each other?”*
* *“What if `docker run` exits immediately after starting?”*

✅ **How to Answer (Example – Restarting Container):**

> “I’ll start by checking `docker logs <container>` to see error messages. Then I inspect exit codes using `docker inspect`.
> Common causes I’ve faced include misconfigured ENV variables, wrong DB connection strings, and app crashing on startup.
> In one case, a Java app crashed due to missing `JVM_OPTS`. I fixed it by passing proper ENV values using `-e` flag in `docker run`.
> To test locally, I ran the container in interactive mode (`docker run -it`) for debugging before redeploying.”

---

## 3. **They Will Check Security & Optimization Knowledge**

Example Questions:

* *“How do you secure Docker containers in production?”*
* *“How do you reduce image size?”*
* *“What tools do you use for image vulnerability scanning?”*

✅ **How to Answer (Example – Security):**

> “In production, I follow best practices:
>
> * Use official, minimal base images (`alpine`, `distroless`).
> * Scan images with **Trivy** or **Clair** in CI/CD pipelines to block vulnerable builds.
> * Run containers as non-root by setting `USER` in Dockerfile.
> * Store secrets outside images (Vault/K8s Secrets).
> * Limit CPU/memory using `--cpus` and `--memory`.
>   In one project, we discovered vulnerabilities in `ubuntu:latest`. Switching to `ubuntu:20.04` and applying Trivy scans reduced risks significantly.”

---

## 4. **They May Give Real-Time Scenarios**

Example Questions:

* *“Your container logs are filling disk space, how will you solve it?”*
* *“Your image size is 1GB, how do you reduce it?”*
* *“A container can’t reach the DB, but DB is running fine — how do you troubleshoot?”*

✅ **How to Answer (Example – Logs Filling Disk Space):**

> “This usually happens with the default `json-file` driver. Logs keep growing in `/var/lib/docker/containers`.
> To fix this, I enable log rotation in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "log-driver": "json-file",
>   "log-opts": {
>     "max-size": "10m",
>     "max-file": "3"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> In production, I forward logs to **centralized logging systems (EFK/ELK/Splunk)** so local logs don’t bloat the host.”

# 📌 20+ Real-Time Docker Interview Questions & Answers (8 Yrs Exp)

---

## 🔹 1. Container Keeps Restarting

**Q:** Your container is restarting again and again. How do you troubleshoot?
**A:**

* Check logs: `docker logs <container-id>`.
* Inspect exit code: `docker inspect <container-id> --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'`.
* Run interactively: `docker run -it <image>` to debug.
* Common issues: missing ENV variables, wrong DB config, app crash.
* Example: In one project, a Spring Boot app crashed because `DB_HOST` ENV was not set in container. Fixed it in Compose file.

---

## 🔹 2. Logs Filling Disk Space

**Q:** Container logs are filling the host disk. What do you do?
**A:**

* Configure log rotation in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "log-opts": { "max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3" }
  }
  ```
* Forward logs to centralized system (ELK/EFK, Splunk, CloudWatch).
* Example: In production, we used **Fluentd DaemonSet** in Kubernetes to send logs to Elasticsearch.

---

## 🔹 3. Image Size Too Large

**Q:** Your image is 1GB, how do you reduce it?
**A:**

* Use smaller base image (`alpine`, `slim`, `distroless`).
* Use **multi-stage builds**.
* Remove package managers & temp files after install (`apt-get clean`).
* Example: Our Node.js image reduced from **900MB → 120MB** using `nginx:alpine` as runtime stage.

---

## 🔹 4. Container Cannot Connect to Database

**Q:** App container can’t connect to DB container. How do you troubleshoot?
**A:**

* Check if both containers are on same network (`docker network ls`).
* Create user-defined bridge network:

  ```bash
  docker network create app-net
  docker run -d --network app-net --name db mysql
  docker run -d --network app-net --name app myapp
  ```
* Use container name as hostname (`db:3306`).
* Example: In one project, DNS resolution failed in default bridge, fixed by creating a custom bridge.

---

## 🔹 5. Container Exits Immediately After Starting

**Q:** Why does a container exit immediately?
**A:**

* Containers run only while their main process is running.
* If the process finishes, container exits.
* Example: Running `docker run ubuntu` exits immediately (no process).
* Fix: Run with `-it` and keep process alive (`tail -f /dev/null`).

---

## 🔹 6. Monitoring Docker Containers

**Q:** How do you monitor containers in production?
**A:**

* Basic: `docker stats`.
* Advanced: **cAdvisor + Prometheus + Grafana**.
* Example: We set up Grafana alerts when memory > 90%, which helped detect OOMKilled containers.

---

## 🔹 7. Security in Docker

**Q:** How do you secure containers in production?
**A:**

* Use official/minimal images.
* Run as non-root (`USER` in Dockerfile).
* Scan images (Trivy, Clair).
* Store secrets outside images (Vault, K8s secrets).
* Example: Integrated Trivy in Jenkins to block vulnerable images.

---

## 🔹 8. Container High CPU/Memory Usage

**Q:** Your container consumes too much CPU/memory. How do you handle it?
**A:**

* Monitor via `docker stats`.
* Limit resources:

  ```bash
  docker run --cpus="2" --memory="1g" myapp
  ```
* Debug memory leaks in app logs.
* Example: In fintech project, limiting CPU prevented noisy neighbor issues in shared nodes.

---

## 🔹 9. Registry Authentication Failed

**Q:** You get `unauthorized: authentication required` while pushing to registry. What do you do?
**A:**

* Run `docker login <registry>`.
* Ensure correct IAM/secret credentials.
* Example: In AWS, we used `aws ecr get-login-password | docker login` in CI pipeline.

---

## 🔹 10. Multi-Container App Setup

**Q:** How do you run a multi-container app locally?
**A:**

* Use **Docker Compose** with `docker-compose.yml`.
* Example:

  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    app:
      build: .
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"
      depends_on:
        - db
    db:
      image: mysql
      environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  ```

---

## 🔹 11. Container Port Not Accessible

**Q:** Your app is running in container but not accessible on host. Troubleshoot?
**A:**

* Check port mapping: `docker ps`.
* Expose correct port in Dockerfile (`EXPOSE 8080`).
* Run with `-p 8080:8080`.
* Example: In one case, app was listening on `127.0.0.1`, fixed by binding to `0.0.0.0`.

---

## 🔹 12. Docker Daemon Disk Full

**Q:** Your host’s `/var/lib/docker` is full. What do you do?
**A:**

* Clean stopped containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`.
* Remove dangling images: `docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)`.
* Prune: `docker system prune -af`.
* Example: We automated cleanup with a cron job in dev environment.

---

## 🔹 13. Debugging Inside Minimal Image

**Q:** Your production container has no debugging tools. What do you do?
**A:**

* Temporary solution: run sidecar container with tools (`busybox`, `alpine`).
* Or rebuild image with debug tools.
* Example: For debugging, we temporarily added `curl` and `bash`, then removed them in final build.

---

## 🔹 14. Private Registry in Enterprise

**Q:** How do you manage private Docker registry?
**A:**

* Use **Harbor, Artifactory, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry**.
* Secure with TLS and IAM auth.
* Example: In one project, we used **Harbor** with vulnerability scanning before promoting images.

---

## 🔹 15. Configuring Persistent Data

**Q:** How do you persist MySQL data in Docker?
**A:**

* Use volumes:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
  ```
* Example: This prevented DB data loss when container restarted.

---

## 🔹 16. CI/CD Pipeline with Docker

**Q:** How did you integrate Docker with CI/CD?
**A:**

* Jenkins pipeline stages:

  1. Build app.
  2. Build Docker image.
  3. Scan with Trivy.
  4. Push to registry.
  5. Deploy with Kubernetes.
* Example: For React app, pipeline built image → scanned → pushed to ECR → deployed on EKS.

---

## 🔹 17. Handling Secrets

**Q:** How do you manage secrets in Docker containers?
**A:**

* Never bake secrets into image.
* Pass as ENV (`-e`), mount as files, or use Vault/K8s Secrets.
* Example: In AWS, DB credentials came from SSM Parameter Store mounted as ENV.

---

## 🔹 18. Orphaned Volumes

**Q:** Disk full due to unused volumes. How do you fix?
**A:**

* List volumes: `docker volume ls`.
* Remove unused: `docker volume prune`.
* Example: In dev cluster, we automated pruning with scripts.

---

## 🔹 19. Difference Between ENTRYPOINT vs CMD

**Q:** When to use ENTRYPOINT vs CMD?
**A:**

* `ENTRYPOINT` = fixed command.
* `CMD` = default args (overridable).
* Example:

  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
  CMD ["--spring.profiles.active=dev"]
  ```

---

## 🔹 20. Container Networking Conflict

**Q:** Two containers need same port, how do you solve it?
**A:**

* Use different host ports: `-p 8080:8080`, `-p 8081:8080`.
* Or use reverse proxy like **NGINX**.
* Example: For 3 microservices, we used Traefik reverse proxy to route traffic.

---

## 🔹 21. Nohup in Docker

**Q:** Why/when use `nohup` in Docker?
**A:**

* For background scripts inside container (testing/debug).
* Example: Ran `nohup ./sync.sh > sync.log 2>&1 & tail -f sync.log` inside a debug container.
* But in production, best practice is **foreground processes** (so Docker can manage lifecycle).

---

# ✅ Summary

At **8 years exp**, your answers must be:

* **Solution-oriented** → not just commands, but *why & how*.
* **Troubleshooting-driven** → logs, inspect, debug steps.
* **Security-aware** → image scanning, non-root, secrets mgmt.
* **Real-time examples** → “In one project, I faced X, solved it with Y.”

---

👉 Next step:
Do you want me to prepare the **same style guide (20+ scenario Q&A)** for **Kubernetes** as well? (Since at 8 yrs exp, they *will* grill you on K8s after Docker.)
Q3: How do you handle persistent data in Docker?

Answer:
By default, container data is ephemeral. For persistence, we use volumes or bind mounts.

Volumes are managed by Docker (docker volume create).

Bind mounts map host paths (-v /host/path:/container/path).
Real-time example: In one project, MySQL inside Docker was losing data after container restart. We solved it by mounting /var/lib/mysql to a Docker volume.
Perfect 👍 thanks for clarifying — you want me to **focus mainly on Docker (with Kubernetes combined where relevant)**, and explain **all real-time issues**, with **detailed troubleshooting**, exactly the way an **8 years experienced engineer** should talk in interviews.

Let’s break it down systematically.

---

# 🚨 Real-Time Docker + K8s Issues (Production Grade for 8 Yrs Exp)

---

## 1. **Image Build & Size Issues**

**Problem:**

* Docker images too large → slow deployments.
* Build caching not working → builds take 20–30 min.
* Wrong base image with vulnerabilities.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Use **multi-stage builds** (`builder` + `runtime`).
* Use `.dockerignore` to exclude junk (logs, node_modules, etc).
* Scan image (`trivy image <img>`).
* Run `docker history <img>` to see why it’s heavy.

**Real-time example:**
“Our Java image was 1.5GB → slowed down EKS deployments. I rebuilt using multi-stage (`maven:3.6-jdk` for build, `openjdk:11-jre-slim` for runtime). Final image: 300MB. We also automated Trivy scans in Jenkins to block vulnerable builds.”

---

## 2. **Container Crashing (Docker level)**

**Problem:**

* App inside container crashes immediately.
* Logs show missing dependency or bad config.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Run interactive shell: `docker run -it <img> sh`.
* Check container logs: `docker logs <cid>`.
* Validate entrypoint: `docker inspect <img> | grep Entrypoint`.

**Real-time:**
“During deployment, a Python container crashed because developer used Windows line endings (`\r\n`). I fixed by adding `dos2unix` in Dockerfile. Later enforced `*.sh` line endings in CI/CD.”

---

## 3. **Port Binding / Service Unreachable**

**Problem:**

* Container runs, but app not accessible.
* `curl localhost:8080` inside works, but not outside.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Check Dockerfile: is app binding `0.0.0.0` or just `127.0.0.1`?
* Verify port exposure: `docker run -p 8080:8080 app`.
* Inspect: `docker ps` → confirm port mapping.

**Real-time:**
“In one case, Node.js app bound to 127.0.0.1 → worked inside, but service unreachable outside. Fixed by binding to `0.0.0.0`. After that, I enforced health-checks in Dockerfile (`HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health`).”

---

## 4. **Data Loss (Volumes not used properly)**

**Problem:**

* Containerized DB loses data after restart.
* Devs use `docker run` without volumes.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Use named volumes:

  ```bash
  docker volume create db_data
  docker run -v db_data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
  ```
* For Kubernetes: PVC + StorageClass.
* Backup/restore with `docker run --rm -v db_data:/data busybox tar cvf /backup/db.tar /data`.

**Real-time:**
“Our MySQL Docker lost data after restart in UAT. Found devs using `emptyDir`. I fixed by creating PVC on EBS (AWS). Now all DB containers mount persistent volumes.”

---

## 5. **Networking Issues**

**Problem:**

* Container-to-container communication fails.
* Wrong network mode used.
* DNS resolution inside container fails.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Inspect networks: `docker network ls`.
* Inspect IPs: `docker inspect <cid>`.
* Use `docker exec -it <cid> ping other-container`.
* If cross-host (K8s): check CNI (Calico/Flannel).

**Real-time:**
“Payment service couldn’t reach DB container. I found they were on default bridge network, while DB was on custom network. Fixed by creating a user-defined bridge. Later moved to Kubernetes overlay networks for multi-host.”

---

## 6. **Image Pull Errors**

**Problem:**

* `ImagePullBackOff` in K8s.
* `docker pull` fails with 403 or auth errors.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Verify tag in registry.
* For private registry:

  ```bash
  docker login my-registry
  kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred ...
  ```
* Check ECR/GCR/ACR IAM roles.

**Real-time:**
“In AWS EKS, pods failed with `ImagePullBackOff` because token expired. I automated token refresh with IAM role for service accounts (IRSA). That eliminated manual secret rotation.”

---

## 7. **Resource Limits (OOMKilled / CPU Throttling)**

**Problem:**

* Container killed with OOMKilled.
* App slow due to CPU throttling.

**Troubleshooting:**

* `docker stats` or `kubectl top pod`.
* Check `kubectl describe pod` → OOMKilled events.
* Tune resource requests/limits.

**Real-time:**
“Our Node.js API container restarted 60+ times/day. Cause: memory limit 256Mi set too low. Increased to 512Mi + optimized caching logic. Added Prometheus alerts for OOM events.”

---

## 8. **Logging Issues**

**Problem:**

* Logs filling up `/var/lib/docker/containers/`.
* App logs not centralized.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Configure log driver:

  ```bash
  docker run --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=10m ...
  ```
* Use Fluentd/ELK/Loki for aggregation.
* Monitor disk usage (`docker system df`).

**Real-time:**
“One night, disk filled up on production node due to unrotated logs. I enabled log rotation with `max-size` and integrated Loki + Grafana for central logging.”

---

## 9. **Docker Daemon / Disk Pressure**

**Problem:**

* Host runs out of disk (images/volumes).
* Pods evicted in Kubernetes.

**Troubleshooting:**

* `docker system prune -a`.
* Move `/var/lib/docker` to larger disk.
* For Kubernetes: monitor node conditions (`kubectl describe node`).

**Real-time:**
“EKS worker nodes started evicting pods due to disk pressure. Found 200+ old images left. I automated cleanup with a cronjob running `docker system prune`. Also separated `/var/lib/docker` to EBS volume.”

---

## 10. **Security Issues**

**Problem:**

* Containers run as root.
* Vulnerabilities in base images.
* Secrets exposed via ENV.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Add `USER appuser` in Dockerfile.
* Scan images with Trivy/Anchore.
* Use K8s Secrets or Vault, not ENV vars.

**Real-time:**
“During audit, we found DB passwords in environment variables. I migrated to Kubernetes Secrets and mounted them as files. Also enforced `USER` directive in Dockerfiles via code review policies.”

---

## 11. **Slow Builds in CI/CD**

**Problem:**

* Each build pulls dependencies from scratch.
* No layer caching.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Cache dependencies using volumes.
* Order Dockerfile: put least frequently changed first.
* Use buildkit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`).

**Real-time:**
“Our Maven build Dockerfile took 25 min. After restructuring (dependencies first, source code last), it dropped to 7 min. Also enabled BuildKit caching across Jenkins agents.”

---

## 12. **K8s-Specific: Pod Not Terminating**

**Problem:**

* Pod stuck in `Terminating`.
* Finalizers not removed.
* Container ignores SIGTERM.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Check finalizers in `kubectl get pod -o yaml`.
* Ensure app handles `SIGTERM` gracefully.
* Force delete: `kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0 --force`.

**Real-time:**
“Our Java service ignored SIGTERM → caused DB corruption. I added shutdown hooks in app to close DB connections gracefully. Also tuned pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.”

---

# 🎯 How You Should Answer (as 8 Yrs Exp)

When asked about issues, **don’t stop at root cause**.
Structure your answer like this:

1. **What happened** (symptom).
2. **How you debugged** (tools/commands).
3. **How you fixed it**.
4. **What you did to prevent it in future**.

That “prevention” step is what makes you sound **senior**.
