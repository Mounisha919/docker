## **Docker Registry**

### **Description**

A **Docker Registry** is a service for storing and distributing Docker images.

* **Docker Hub** ‚Üí default public registry.
* **Private registries** ‚Üí for secure, internal usage (Harbor, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, Azure ACR, JFrog Artifactory).
* Used in **CI/CD pipelines** to push images after builds and pull them during deployments.
* Supports **versioning** using tags (`v1.0`, `latest`, `prod`).
* Can be configured with **authentication, TLS, and access control**.

**Workflow Example:**

1. Build image ‚Üí `docker build -t myapp:v1 .`
2. Tag image ‚Üí `docker tag myapp:v1 myregistry.com/project/myapp:v1`
3. Push image ‚Üí `docker push myregistry.com/project/myapp:v1`
4. Deploy ‚Üí Pull image from registry into Kubernetes/Docker host.

### **Common Issues (Real-Time Scenarios)**

1. **Authentication Failure**

   * Pushing image fails with `unauthorized: authentication required`.
   * Fix: Run `docker login <registry>` with correct credentials; check IAM roles (ECR/ACR).

2. **SSL/TLS Certificate Errors**

   * Error: `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.
   * Fix: Use valid SSL certificates; for dev/test allow insecure registry (not in prod).

3. **Docker Hub Rate Limits**

   * Error: `429 Too Many Requests`.
   * Fix: Authenticate with Docker Hub; use mirror registry; prefer private registry.

4. **Image Not Found**

   * Error: `manifest not found`.
   * Fix: Verify repo name, tag, and namespace.

5. **Slow Push/Pull**

   * Large images delay pipelines.
   * Fix: Optimize Dockerfiles (multi-stage builds, Alpine base image), use caching.

6. **Permission Denied on Push**

   * User cannot push to registry.
   * Fix: Assign correct roles (developer, admin) or IAM permissions.

7. **Registry Out of Storage**

   * Registry server runs out of disk.
   * Fix: Enable garbage collection, prune old images, expand storage.

8. **Overwritten Tags**

   * Accidentally overwrote `latest` breaking prod.
   * Fix: Use **immutable tags** (`v1.0.1`, `build-123`) and enforce policies.

9. **Orphaned Images**

   * Old unreferenced images pile up.
   * Fix: Enable retention policies and garbage collection.

10. **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**

* Jenkins/GitLab pipeline cannot push images.
* Fix: Store credentials securely, login before push.

### **Top 10 Issues with Solutions**

| **Issue**            | **Scenario**           | **Solution**                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Auth Failure      | Unauthorized error     | Run `docker login`, check creds/IAM                |
| 2. SSL Errors        | Self-signed certs      | Install trusted certs, avoid insecure mode in prod |
| 3. Rate Limits       | Docker Hub throttling  | Use private registry or authenticated pulls        |
| 4. Image Not Found   | Wrong tag              | Verify image:tag spelling & namespace              |
| 5. Slow Push/Pull    | Large image delays     | Use Alpine/multi-stage builds, caching             |
| 6. Permission Denied | Cannot push            | Check repo/IAM permissions                         |
| 7. Storage Full      | Registry out of space  | Garbage collection, prune old images               |
| 8. Tag Overwrite     | `latest` overwritten   | Enforce immutable tags/versioning                  |
| 9. Orphaned Images   | Old unused images      | Use retention + GC                                 |
| 10. CI/CD Failures   | Push in pipeline fails | Secure creds, `docker login` in pipeline           |

### **Scenario-Based Tricky Interview Questions**

**1. Scenario: Unauthorized in CI/CD**
**Q:** Jenkins pipeline fails with `unauthorized: authentication required` while pushing to AWS ECR. How do you solve it?
**A:** Use AWS CLI to authenticate before push:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

---

**2. Scenario: Rate limits from Docker Hub**
**Q:** Builds are failing due to Docker Hub pull limits. What‚Äôs your approach?
**A:**

* Authenticate with Docker Hub (higher limits).
* Use a caching proxy or mirror registry.
* Switch to private registry (ECR/ACR/GCP).

---

**3. Scenario: Prod broken due to overwritten tag**
**Q:** A developer overwrote the `latest` tag by mistake. How do you prevent this?
**A:**

* Use immutable tags (`v1.2.3`, `release-45`).
* Enforce tag policies in CI/CD.
* Implement Git-based version tagging.

---

**4. Scenario: Registry disk is full**
**Q:** Private registry is out of space. What‚Äôs your action plan?
**A:**

* Run garbage collection to remove unused layers.
* Set lifecycle policies to auto-delete old tags.
* Expand storage backend if necessary.

---

**5. Scenario: Slow Kubernetes pod startup**
**Q:** Pods take too long to start due to image pull delays. How do you fix it?
**A:**

* Optimize image size (multi-stage builds, Alpine base).
* Pre-pull images on nodes (`imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`).
* Use registry close to cluster (ECR for AWS, ACR for Azure).
