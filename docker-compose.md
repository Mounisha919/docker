## **Docker Compose**

### **Description**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications using a **single YAML file** (`docker-compose.yml`). It allows you to define services, networks, and volumes, then start and manage the entire stack with simple commands like `docker-compose up`.

**Key Points:**

* Defines multiple containers, their dependencies, networks, and volumes.
* Supports environment variables, port mapping, and scaling services.
* Simplifies complex deployments by providing one command to manage multi-container apps.
* Common commands:

  * `docker-compose up` – start all services.
  * `docker-compose down` – stop and remove containers, networks.
  * `docker-compose logs` – view logs for all services.
  * `docker-compose scale <service>=<num>` – scale a service (deprecated in v3, use `replicas` in `deploy` for Swarm).

---

### **Common Issues Faced with Real-Time Scenarios**

1. **Service Not Starting**

   * **Scenario:** `docker-compose up` fails with a service dependency error.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Check `depends_on` order, image availability, and network configuration.

2. **Port Conflicts**

   * **Scenario:** Container cannot start due to port already in use.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Verify host ports are free or map to different ports in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**

   * **Scenario:** App cannot connect to DB; environment variables are missing.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Check `.env` file placement and syntax; ensure `env_file` or `environment` section is correct.

4. **Volume Mount Issues**

   * **Scenario:** Container cannot persist data or sees wrong content.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Check volume definitions, named vs. bind mount, and permissions.

5. **Network Issues**

   * **Scenario:** Services cannot communicate.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Ensure services are on the same network; check service names as DNS.

6. **Dependency Wait**

   * **Scenario:** App starts before the database is ready, causing errors.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Implement **wait-for-it** scripts or healthchecks in `docker-compose.yml`.

7. **Image Not Found**

   * **Scenario:** `docker-compose up` fails with `image not found`.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Build locally (`docker-compose build`) or ensure image exists in registry.

8. **Scaling Services**

   * **Scenario:** Scaling service fails or containers cannot communicate.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Use `deploy.replicas` (Swarm mode) and ensure service discovery works via DNS.

9. **Logs Management**

   * **Scenario:** Cannot see logs of all services or logs are too verbose.
   * **Troubleshoot:** Use `docker-compose logs --tail 50 -f <service>` for filtered logs.

10. **Orphaned Containers**

    * **Scenario:** Old containers persist after `docker-compose up`.
    * **Troubleshoot:** Use `docker-compose down --remove-orphans`.

### **Top 10 Docker Compose Issues with Solutions**

| **Issue**                        | **Description / Real-Time Scenario**    | **Solution / Troubleshoot**                                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Service Not Starting          | `db` service fails due to dependency    | Use `depends_on` and healthchecks; verify images                   |
| 2. Port Conflicts                | Host port 8080 already in use           | Change port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`                        |
| 3. Environment Variables Missing | App cannot connect to DB                | Use `.env` file, check `env_file` section                          |
| 4. Volume Mount Issues           | Data not persisting                     | Check named vs bind volumes and permissions                        |
| 5. Network Issues                | Services cannot reach each other        | Ensure all services are on same network; use service names for DNS |
| 6. Dependency Wait               | App starts before DB ready              | Use healthchecks or wait-for-it scripts                            |
| 7. Image Not Found               | Pull fails or image missing             | Build locally or push image to registry                            |
| 8. Scaling Issues                | Multiple containers fail to communicate | Use Swarm mode with `deploy.replicas`; check network and DNS       |
| 9. Logs Management               | Logs too verbose or missing             | Use `docker-compose logs` with `--tail` or `-f` for filtering      |
| 10. Orphaned Containers          | Old containers persist after update     | Run `docker-compose down --remove-orphans`                         |

### **Scenario-Based Tricky Interview Questions**

**1. Scenario: Multi-container app fails to start because DB is not ready**
**Question:** Your web app container keeps crashing on startup due to DB not ready. How do you handle it?
**Answer:** Use **healthchecks** in `docker-compose.yml` for DB and `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`. Alternatively, use `wait-for-it` script to delay web container start until DB is ready.

---

**2. Scenario: Two services need different networks**
**Question:** How do you separate frontend and backend containers into different networks but allow communication for specific services?
**Answer:** Define multiple networks in `docker-compose.yml` and attach services selectively. Use network aliases for inter-service communication.

---

**3. Scenario: Environment variables not loading in production**
**Question:** `.env` variables work locally but not in production compose stack. Why?
**Answer:** Ensure `.env` is in the correct directory; check syntax (`KEY=value`) and verify `env_file` section in compose file. Production may need secrets or config maps instead.

---

**4. Scenario: Scaling a web service breaks DB connectivity**
**Question:** Scaling web app to 3 replicas breaks database connectivity. What could be wrong?
**Answer:** Ensure the database service can handle multiple connections, use service name as DNS, and consider using **replicated database or connection pool** for scaled services.

---

**5. Scenario: Old containers remain after `docker-compose up`**
**Question:** Why do orphan containers appear and how do you clean them?
**Answer:** Old containers from previous compose versions remain. Clean using:

```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```

Regular use of `down` prevents accumulation.
